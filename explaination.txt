The provided code defines a simple Python class named `CogniGraph`, which represents a basic cognitive computing graph library using the NetworkX library. Here's an explanation of the key components and functionality:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `__init__` method initializes an instance of the class with an empty graph using the NetworkX library.

2. **Adding Cognitive Entities:**
   - `add_cognitive_entity` method adds a cognitive entity to the graph.
   - `entity_id`: Unique identifier for the cognitive entity.
   - `attributes`: A dictionary containing attributes of the cognitive entity (default is an empty dictionary).

3. **Adding Relationships:**
   - `add_relationship` method establishes a relationship between two cognitive entities in the graph.
   - `entity1`, `entity2`: Unique identifiers of the cognitive entities.
   - `relationship_type`: Type of relationship between the entities.
   - `weight`: Strength of the relationship (default is 1.0).

4. **Simulating Neuroplasticity:**
   - `simulate_neuroplasticity` method simulates neuroplasticity for a specific cognitive entity by adjusting the weights of its relationships with neighbors.
   - `entity_id`: Unique identifier of the cognitive entity.
   - `learning_rate`: Rate at which the entity adapts to new information (default is 0.1).

5. **Retrieving Entity Attributes and Relationships:**
   - `get_entity_attributes` method retrieves the attributes of a specific cognitive entity.
   - `get_relationships` method retrieves the relationships of a specific cognitive entity in the form of a list of tuples, each containing neighbor, relationship type, and weight.

6. **Example Usage:**
   - An instance of `CogniGraph` is created (`cogni_graph`).
   - Cognitive entities ("entity1" and "entity2") with associated attributes are added.
   - A relationship of type "ConnectsTo" with a weight of 0.8 is established between "entity1" and "entity2."
   - Neuroplasticity is simulated for "entity1."
   - The attributes and relationships of "entity1" are retrieved and printed.

This code provides a basic framework for building a cognitive graph, where entities can be added, relationships established, and neuroplasticity simulated. You can extend this code for more advanced features and additional functionality based on your specific requirements.
